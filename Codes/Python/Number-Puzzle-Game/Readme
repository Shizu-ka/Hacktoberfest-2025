# 🧩 Number Puzzle Game

A lightweight, console-based **Number Puzzle Game** implemented in Python.  
The objective is to arrange the numbers **1–8** in ascending order by sliding tiles into the empty space.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic 8-puzzle (3×3 sliding puzzle).  
It demonstrates basic Python concepts such as loops, lists, conditionals, and user interaction.

The puzzle starts in a randomized configuration, and the player can move the empty space using simple commands until all tiles are correctly arranged.

## 🎯 Objective

Arrange the numbers to achieve the following order:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Number-Puzzle-Game.git
cd Number-Puzzle-Game
2. Run the Game
bash
Copy code
python Puzzle_game.py
3. Play
Use the following commands to move the blank space:

css
Copy code
up
down
left
right
Type quit to exit the game.

🧠 Game Logic
The game board is represented as a 3×3 list of lists.

The blank space is represented by 0.

A random shuffle generates the initial layout.

The player moves the blank space using direction commands.

The game checks if the current state matches the solved configuration.
